<h2>WCAG 2.0 success criteria</h2>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Level AA - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast"
                      target="_blank">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a></dt>
    <dd>4.5:1 if font-size is smaller than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
    <dd>3:1 if font-size is greater than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
    <dt>Level AAA - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast7"
                       target="_blank">1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)</a></dt>
    <dd>7:1 if font-size is smaller than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
    <dd>4.5:1 if font-size is greater than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
</dl>
<p>The success criteria don't apply for <strong>incidental text</strong> (text or images of text that are part
    of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part
    of a picture that contains significant other visual content) or <strong>logotypes</strong>.</p>

<h2>WCAG Contrast Checker</h2>
<p>It is a browser extension that analyses the contrast between the foreground and the background of all elements in the
    page. It identifies the computed colors and also considers the opacity of the background in order to determine the
    visual value.</p>
<p>The extension does not consider images. This means that if the element is an image, the detected color for the
    foreground would be the one that its alternative text would have, and if if the element includes and image as
    background, the background color would be the one that it has defined without considering the image.</p>

<h3>Visible and Hidden elements</h3>
<p><strong>Visible elements</strong> are the elements that don't use CSS properties "display"
    or "visibility" with values "none" or "hidden" respectively. Because there could be other ways for hiding elements,
    this list could include some that are also hidden or outside of the view-port area.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden elements</strong> are the elements that use CSS properties "display"
    or "visibility" with values "none" or "hidden" respectively. These elements are usually part of collapsible
    menus, panels, flyouts, etc. The page could still have other hidden elements that were not detected
    automatically.</p>

<h3>Refresh on DOM updates</h3>
<p>The analysis can be performed to be executed on every DOM modification (additions or remove of DOM elements) or
    on-demand. If it is executed automatically when de DOM is modified, it includes a debouncing time in order to
    prevent unneeded repetitions that could affect to the performance. When this feature is deactivated, it is possible
    to update the analysis manually by using the button "refresh".</p>
