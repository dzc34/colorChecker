    <h2>WCAG 2.0</h2>
    <p>WCAG 2.0 includes two success criteria that are meant to give the developers the information to ensure the
        contrast
        between the content and its background is enough to ensure it is fully <strong>perceivable</strong>. The two
        criteria only differs in the thresholds for the contrast ratio and one is for the level AA and the other for
        AAA.
    </p>
    <p>According to them, to ensure that the visual presentation of text (and images of text) is distinguishable, the
        contrast ratio (based on the font-size) should be at least:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>For level AA - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast"
                              target="_blank">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a></dt>
        <dd><strong>4.5</strong> - font-size small</dd>
        <dd><strong>3</strong> - font-size large</dd>
        <dt>For level AAA - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast7"
                               target="_blank">1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)</a></dt>
        <dd><strong>7</strong> - font-size small</dd>
        <dd><strong>4.5</strong> - font-size large</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>According to the WCAG, <strong>small font</strong> is when the computed font-size for the text is smaller than 18
        point or 14 point bold. Otherwise, it would be <strong>consider large</strong>.</p>

    <p>The success criteria do not apply for <strong>incidental text or logotypes</strong>. Incidental text is the text
        (or images of text) that is part of an inactive user interface component, that is pure decoration, that is
        not visible to anyone, or that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.
    </p>

    <h2>WCAG Contrast Checker</h2>
    <p>It is a browser extension that analyses the <strong>contrast between the foreground and the background of all
        elements</strong> in the page. It identifies the computed colors and also considers the opacity of the
        background in order to determine the visual value. In addition to the contrast value, it also gets the computed
        font-size for the elements, so it can evaluate if the contrast is valid or not according to the WCAG 2.0
        validation level (AA or AAA).
    </p>
    <p>The extension does not consider images. This means that if the element is an image, the detected color for the
        foreground would be the one that its alternative text would have, and if if the element includes and image as
        background, the background color would be the one that it has defined without considering the image.</p>

    <h3>Visible and Hidden elements</h3>
    <p><strong>Visible elements</strong> are the elements that do not use (or are not descendant of an element that
        uses) CSS properties "display" or "visibility" with values "none" or "hidden" respectively. Because there could
        be other ways for hiding elements, this list could include some that are also hidden or outside of the view-port
        area.</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden elements</strong> are the elements that use (or are descendant of an element that uses) the CSS
        properties "display" or "visibility" with values "none" or "hidden" respectively. These elements are usually
        part of collapsible menus, panels, fly-outs, etc. The page could still have other hidden elements that were not
        detected automatically. We should not consider these elements as <em>incidental text</em> since they could be
        shown under some circumstances like after user interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Refresh on DOM updates</h3>
    <p>The analysis can be performed to be executed on every DOM modification (additions or remove of DOM elements) or
        on-demand. If it is executed automatically when de DOM is modified, it includes a debouncing time in order to
        prevent unneeded repetitions that could affect to the performance. When this feature is deactivated, it is
        possible to update the analysis manually by using the button "refresh".</p>

    <h3>Custom color analysis</h3>
    <p>The extension includes a color analyser that allows to select (or to introduce manually) a color combination to
        check the contrast difference between them and validate it according to different font sizes.</p>
