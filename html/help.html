    <h2>WCAG 2.0</h2>
    <p>WCAG 2.0 includes two success criteria that are meant to give the developers the information to ensure the
        contrast
        between the content and its background is enough to ensure it is fully <strong>perceivable</strong>. The two
        criteria only differs in the thresholds for the contrast ratio and one is for the level AA and the other for
        AAA.
    </p>
    <p>According to them, the visual presentation of text (and images of text), to ensure is distinguishable, should
        have a
        contrast ratio of at least:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Level AA - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast"
                          target="_blank">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a></dt>
        <dd>4.5:1 if font-size is smaller than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
        <dd>3:1 if font-size is greater than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
        <dt>Level AAA - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast7"
                           target="_blank">1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)</a></dt>
        <dd>7:1 if font-size is smaller than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
        <dd>4.5:1 if font-size is greater than 18 point or 14 point bold</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The success criteria do not apply for <strong>incidental text</strong> or <strong>logotypes</strong>. Incidental
        text
        is the text (or images of text) that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration,
        that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.
    </p>

    <h2>WCAG Contrast Checker</h2>
    <p>It is a browser extension that analyses the <strong>contrast between the foreground and the background of all
        elements</strong> in the page. It identifies the computed colors and also considers the opacity of the
        background in
        order to determine the visual value. In addition to the contrast value, it also gets the computed font-size for
        the
        elements, so it can evaluate if the contrast is valid or not according to the WCAG 2.0 validation level (AA or
        AAA).
    </p>
    <p>The extension does not consider images. This means that if the element is an image, the detected color for the
        foreground would be the one that its alternative text would have, and if if the element includes and image as
        background, the background color would be the one that it has defined without considering the image.</p>

    <h3>Visible and Hidden elements</h3>
    <p><strong>Visible elements</strong> are the elements that do not use CSS properties "display" or "visibility" with
        values "none" or "hidden" respectively. Because there could be other ways for hiding elements, this list could
        include some that are also hidden or outside of the view-port area.</p>
    <p><strong>Hidden elements</strong> are the elements that use CSS properties "display" or "visibility" with values
        "none" or "hidden" respectively. These elements are usually part of collapsible menus, panels, fly-outs, etc.
        The
        page could still have other hidden elements that were not detected automatically. We should not consider these
        elements as <em>indicental text</em> since they could be shown under some circumstances like after user
        interaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Refresh on DOM updates</h3>
    <p>The analysis can be performed to be executed on every DOM modification (additions or remove of DOM elements) or
        on-demand. If it is executed automatically when de DOM is modified, it includes a debouncing time in order to
        prevent unneeded repetitions that could affect to the performance. When this feature is deactivated, it is
        possible
        to update the analysis manually by using the button "refresh".</p>

    <h3>Custom color analysis</h3>
    <p>The extension includes a color analyser that allows to select (or to introduce manually) a color combination to
        check
        the contrast difference between them and validate it according to different font sizes.</p>
